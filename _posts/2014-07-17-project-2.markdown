description: Finding a Parking spot in a busy area is the most painful thing for any person. An average person spends a lot of time finding a parking spot. To solve this problem we have come up with a basic web application to help people find parking spots near to the location where they want to visit. We use the data given to us by the users and show available parking based on the real-time location data available with us. This application is highly scalable and cloud-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/LOisCaxRSK4">Youtube Link to the Demo</a>.
