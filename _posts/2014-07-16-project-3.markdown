description: We have developed a website like social media application for food lovers. Inspired from Indian application named “Zomato” which gives review about the restaurants and different sets of cuisines from various cultures, we have slightly modified the idea to develop our application. In our application, user will have their account and can perform various activities. User can share recipes with each other, connect with each other by forming a group, organizing the events, and can view the activities of their followers. <a href="https://cookzilla.000webhostapp.com/">Find Live Demo Here</a>.
